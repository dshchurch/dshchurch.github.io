        <summary>Weddings</summary>
        <p>
            Your wedding marks the start of your married life together, and can be marked by a ceremony
            before God, as well as with your friends and family.<br>
            Your wedding ceremony should be personal to you, so the minister will be happy to help you plan
            your service to make it as meaningful as possible. It is important to set the date, time and location of
            the wedding with the minister first and as early as possible.<br>
            In the Church of Scotland, there is no fee for the services of the minister. However, if you are able to
            contribute financially, there is a suggested fee to both the church officer and the organist as well as
            for the use of the church building itself : Church £275 ; Church Officer £80; Organist £120<br>
            (We don’t want these fees to be a barrier to anyone, please speak to Rev Jenny if they are a
            problem.)<br>

        <summary>Baptism (Christening)</summary>
        <p>
            The sacrament of baptism is the ceremony of welcome into the worldwide family of the church. A
            sacrament is a sign or symbol, and in baptism ordinary water becomes a sign of God’s love for us all.
            Whether or not we know or understand it, God loves us first, and as we grow we can respond to
            God’s love with faith and love.<br>
            Baptism is a once-in-your-life sacrament. Traditionally most baptisms have been of children, which
            reminds us that God’s love is not dependent on our understanding. But adults of any age may also
            wish to be baptised, if they have not already been.<br>
            As baptism welcomes someone into the family of the church, it would normally take place during a
            regular church service of the local congregation, to which your family and friends are all most
            welcome.<br>
            In infant baptism, parent(s) and/or sponsor(s) are asked to confess their faith, and make promises to
            bring the child up in the life of the church.<br>
            In adult baptism, the person themselves confesses their faith and makes promises.<br>
            In all cases, the congregation commits itself to welcoming and supporting all members of the church
            family.<br>
            For any further information, or to discuss any possible arrangements, please contact a minister (see home page).

        <summary>Blessing of a child</summary>
        <p>
            For some parents, they may wish to give thanks for the gift of a child, but feel baptism is not right for
            them. Some prefer to give their child the chance to make a decision about baptism for themselves
            when they are older. Some might find the promises and confession asked in a service of baptism to
            be beyond what they are happy to commit to.<br>
            In those cases, a child can be blessed during a service of worship. There is no water, and no promises
            or commitments are asked of the parents or godparents. However, it allows family and friends, and
            the church family, to gather before God, to celebrate this new life, and to give the support all
            families need.<br>
            For any further information, or to discuss any possible arrangements, please contact a minister (see home page).

        <summary>Pastoral Support</summary>
        <p>
            The church exists to serve others – and in doing so, we serve God. As a parish church, we are called
            to serve the people and communities of Duffus, Spynie & Hopeman – in times of celebration and of
            sorrow, and in all aspects of daily life.<br>
            Most of the support and work of the church is carried out by our many members, as they go about
            their normal lives – as family members, friends and neighbours, and through work, whether paid or
            voluntary.<br>
            But there may be certain circumstances where additional support may be helpful. For some
            particular directed support, the contacts for support services below may be helpful. For pastoral,
            spiritual or religious support, please contact a minister (see home page).
